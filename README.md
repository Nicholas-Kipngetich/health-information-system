- **Register Clients**: New clients can be registered in the system with relevant information.
- **Enroll Clients in Programs**: Doctors can enroll clients in one or more health programs.
- **Search Clients**: Doctors can search for clients from the list of registered clients.
- **View Client Profiles**: View detailed client profiles, including the programs they are enrolled in.
- **Expose Client Profiles via API**: Client profiles can be accessed through a RESTful API.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java)
- **Frontend**: React (for the user interface)
